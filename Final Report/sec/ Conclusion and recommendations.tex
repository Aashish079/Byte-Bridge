\section{CONCLUSION AND RECOMENDATION}

\hspace{5mm} We designed and built this project using the basic principles of Object Oriented Programming along with Simple and Fast Multimedia Library. The use of OOP easily organized our code into different modules and implement those modules at the required time. \\

The use of game class showcases this idea, where we have created a game class and just updated and rendered it in the main class. But as we go deeper into the implementation in game class, we see the actual commands. This abstraction is visible throughout the program and it made coding it much easier. Further, the use of a graphic library came in quite handy as well. The design of the UI of the game became very much easier and it saved us from coding thousands of lines of code. We also learned the need for planning, execution, and testing. The game logic is the same as the classical Tetris game, but the design and implementation are different.
