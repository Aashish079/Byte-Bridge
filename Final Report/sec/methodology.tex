\section{METHODOLOGY}
\hspace{5mm}This proposed project aims to develop a Tetris game using Object-Oriented Programming principles and the SFML library for graphics. The project will be implemented using the CLion Integrated Development Environment and will utilize CMake for cross-platform build support. Version control and collaborative coding will be facilitated through Git and GitHub.\\

To ensure a structured and maintainable codebase, we will design the class hierarchy for the game. Different classes will be created to represent game objects such as the game board, tetrominoes, and scoring system. We will employ OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to achieve modularity and code reusability. The game logic will be implemented within the classes defined in the previous step. Each class will have private and public member variables and member functions that handle specific aspects of the game, such as moving and rotating tetrominoes, checking for line clears, and updating the score. The SFML library will be utilized for rendering graphics and handling user input.\\

To facilitate collaboration among team members, we will utilize Git and GitHub for version control. Each team member will have their own branch to work on individual features or bug fixes. Regular commits and pull requests will be used to review and merge code changes. GitHub's issue tracking feature will also be utilized to manage and prioritize tasks. Proper documentation will be maintained to provide an overview of the project structure, class hierarchy, and function specifications. Additionally, a user guide will be created to assist players in understanding the game controls, rules, and scoring system.\\

This approach will ensure a systematic development process and deliver a high-quality game experience to the users.
