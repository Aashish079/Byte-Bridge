\section{LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS}

\hspace{5mm} We have tried to include most of the features in our game but with limited time, we could not include everything. In our version of this game, we could have created multiplayer mode but this remains a limitation to our program primarily because we did not have the time to include it in our project. This feature will certainly be added in the next update to the game.\\

Also we had thought of adding special feature like drop of bomb after clearing multiple rows and could have made UI more responsive adaptable to different window sizes but we couldn't add them due to lack of time.\\


 Further, we believe that we could further organize our code and make it much cleaner and easier to read. We could have used the object-oriented approach more effectively.\\
 
  In the future, we can further re-organize the code and make a much faster game. On top of that, we could allow multiplayer over the internet. This would be an exciting feature but we believe itâ€™s outside the scope of the project.
